# ofw-abuse-proxy-search

Tools and code for exploring proxies of abuse against Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) using search data (Google Trends, SerpAPI).

## Overview
This project investigates whether Google search intensity and query results can serve as a proxy measure for reported cases of OFW abuse and contract violations.  We aim to supplement official data (e.g., POLO/DOLE records) with open online signals to evaluate policy impacts. 

## Requirements
- R (â‰¥ 4.3)
- Packages: `httr2`, `jsonlite`, `dplyr`, `purrr`, `stringr`, `readr`, `tibble`, `gtrendsR`
- A [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/) account and API key.
